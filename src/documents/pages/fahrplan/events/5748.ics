DESCRIPTION:While recent events have finally made the world at large real
 ize that the exhaustive deployment and use of cryptography throughout th
 e Internet can no longer be deferred\, there is now a good chance that p
 eople will be given a false sense of security once cryptographic support
  has been added and enabled.  This talk points out the limitations inher
 ent in real-world cryptography\, from its underlying principles to its o
 peration\,
